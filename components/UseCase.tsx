          <p className='italic'>Replace “Like” with “Stake” and put your native token to work</p>
          <p>Introducing PSPs to each user profile and allowing other users to stake with them. </p>
          <p>This brings in an additional reputation layer, allows stakers to get a piece of the NFT revenue, and provides a new utility for the native token of the marketplace.</p>

          <h3>NFT Collections</h3>
          <p className='italic'>Establish trust and reward your earliest community</p>
          <p>The success of NFT collection drops is closely tied to the health of the community supporting it from the get-go.</p>
          <p>A PSP paired with the main NFT minting contract would act as a &quot;social underwriting&quot; mechanism to establish the reputation of the collection.</p>

          <h3>Metaverse</h3>
          <p className='italic'>Reputation in a decentralized, permissionless environment</p>
          <p>In an open metaverse, every element, including game items, avatars, collectibles, land titles, etc. would be represented with an NFT.</p>
          <p>A reputation and trust layer will help filter out the good players from bad ones and help towards sustaining a healthy meta economy.</p>
